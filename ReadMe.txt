Hello User of my Repository.

You landed on the repository for LiquidTreasure.
LiquidTreasure is a plugin for HonorBuddy, a World of Warcraft bot.
This is a trivial little addon that opens and loot the Treasures troughout the gameworld.

Whenever there's a Treasure, LiquidTreasure will kick in and send your char on it's way to the item.
Once arrived LiquidTreasure loots the item, content or whatever it is that it found.
Also works for most MoP treasures.

Any bugs? Report em on the forums in the LiquidTreasure topic.

Thanks, LiquidAtoR.
